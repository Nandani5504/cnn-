Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) -
are a type of deep learning algorithm that has demonstrated excellent performance in computer vision 
applications such as picture classification, object recognition Basic idea was to make a trainee model that and than also test it

In this project, 
we create and test CNN models in C++. 
Implementing CNNs in C++ allows us to obtain a better knowledge of how the network works,
the underlying mathematics, and the logic behind it. 
This strategy not only broadens our conceptual knowledge but also improves our logical reasoning and problem-solving abilities. 
Understanding the low-level implementation details provides useful insights into how CNNs work, 
which may be used to improve performance and design new algorithms.
writing the logic and purpose alongside the code explains the understanding
it also widens our research abilities .
Then cnn gets trained by the number of image we want and then can also be tested.
